design_task:
  description: >
    Take the high level requirements described here and prepare a detailed design for the engineer;
    everything should be in 1 python module, but outline the classes and methods in the module.
    Here are the requirements: {requirements}
    IMPORTANT: Only output the design in markdown format, laying out in detail the classes and functions in the module, describing the functionality.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed design for the engineer, identifying the classes and functions in the module.
  agent: leader
  output_file: output/{module_name}_design.md

code_task:
  description: >
    Write a python module that implements the design described by the engineering lead.
    
    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Output ONLY raw Python code - no explanations, no markdown, no comments outside the code
    2. Do NOT include any text before or after the code
    3. Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```) or any formatting
    4. The first line must be valid Python (import or class definition)
    5. Every line must be executable Python code or Python comments
    
    Here are the requirements: {requirements}
  expected_output: >
    Pure Python code that can be directly saved as {module_name} and executed.
    NO markdown formatting. NO explanations. ONLY Python code.
    The output must start with 'from' or 'import' or 'class' or '#' - nothing else.

frontend_task:
  description: >
    Write a gradio UI in a module app.py that demonstrates the given backend class in {module_name}.
    Assume there is only 1 user, and keep the UI very simple indeed - just a prototype or demo.
    Here are the requirements: {requirements}
  expected_output: >
    A gradio UI in module app.py that demonstrates the given backend class.
    The file should be ready so that it can be run as-is, in the same directory as the backend module, and it should import the backend class from {module_name}.
    IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the raw Python code without any markdown formatting, code block delimiters, or backticks.
    The output should be valid Python code that can be directly saved to a file and executed.

test_task:
  description: >
    Write unit tests for the given backend module {module_name} and create a test_{module_name} in the same directory as the backend module.
  expected_output: >
    A test_{module_name} module that tests the given backend module.
    IMPORTANT: Output ONLY the raw Python code without any markdown formatting, code block delimiters, or backticks.
    The output should be valid and raw Python code that can be directly saved to a file and executed.
